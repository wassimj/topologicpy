    "# Bridges and Cut Vertices in Graph Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "In graph theory, **bridges** and **cut vertices** are critical concepts for understanding the structure and resilience of graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bridges**: A bridge, or a cut-edge, is an edge in a graph whose removal increases the number of connected components. Bridges are crucial for identifying weak points in a network, as their failure can disconnect parts of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cut Vertices**: Cut vertices is a set of vertices whose removal disconnects the graph into two or more components. Vertex cuts provide insight into the graph's connectivity and robustness.\n"
